## Lending Club Case Study


##### Business Problem:

The data given in this file ("loan.csv")  contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

##### Files :
1. loan.csv  : Input File for analysis
2. Data_Dictionary : Meta data Info of Loan.csv File Fields
